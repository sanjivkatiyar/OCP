/*
While modularizing an app in a top-down approach, you need to remember the following points -
1. Any jar file can be converted into an automatic module by simply putting that jar
on the module-path instead of the classpath. Java automatically derives the name of this module
from the name of the jar file.

2. Any jar that is put on classpath (instead of module-path) is loaded as a part of the "unnamed" module.

3. An explicitly named module (which means, a module that has an explicitly defined name in its module-info.java file)
can specify dependency on an automatic module just like it does for any other module
i.e. by adding a requires <module-name>; clause in its module info but it cannot do
so for the unnamed module because there is no way to write a requires clause without a name.
In other words,

a named module can access classes present in an automatic module but not in the unnamed module.

4. Automatic modules are given access to classes in the unnamed module
(even though there is no explicitly defined module-info and requires clause in an automatic module).

In other words, a class from an automatic module will be able to read a class in the unnamed module
without doing anything special.

5. An automatic module exports all its packages and is allowed to read all packages exported by other modules.
Thus, an automatic module can access: all packages of all other automatic modules +
all packages exported by all explicitly named modules + all packages of the unnamed module
(i.e. classes loaded from the classpath)
.
Thus, if your application jar A directly uses a class from another jar B,
then you would have to convert B into a module (either named or automatic). If B uses another jar C,
then you can leave C on the class path if B hasn't yet been migrated into a named module. Otherwise,
you would have to convert C into an automatic module as well.
Note: There are two possible ways for an automatic module to get its name:
1. When an Automatic-Module-Name entry is available in the manifest, its value is the name of the automatic module.
2. Otherwise, a name is derived from the JAR filename (see the ModuleFinder JavaDoc for the derivation algorithm)
- Basically, hyphens are converted into dots and the version number part is ignored.
So, for example, if you put mysql-connector-java-8.0.11.jar on module path,
its module name would be mysql.connector.java
